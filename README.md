# Contact App

* A simple web site with some contacts related to somes companies, like an agenda.

## Usage

- You can apply all RESTFUL operations to those contacts & to companies also.
- You can even filter them by multiples fields like company, first_name, last_name, and so on...

For an easy start you can run the command:

`` php artisan migrate:fresh --seed .``

You will then get some fake data ( users, companies, and contacts) to quickly test.

Each user has some companies with some contacts related.

Test Them and add more data on choice.

 `Enjoy :)` .
